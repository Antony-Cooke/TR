    <h2>Description:</h2>
    <p>This website is my attempt to document what I have been taught on the TechReturners training course at      <br>The Landing, Media City, Salford Quays over 12 weeks, April - July 2018. This course was set up and     <br>administered primarily by Beckie Taylor, ably assisted by Laura Kenny, who did the majority of the      <br>presenting, the two James(es), Heggs and Medd and, of course, Kavita</p>
